I'm a third year at University of California, Davis, majoring in **Computer Science** with a planned minor in film.  

I know **C++, C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Intel x86 Assembly, Lisp, Prolog, and Autohotkey**. I'm very active in my engineering fraternity [(Theta Tau)](http://www.davisthetatau.com/), and in my spare time I design, shoot short films, browse reddit, and hunt for new music.

In the future I'd like to work in front end web dev, or as a mobile developer, where I can combine my coding skills and my eye for graphic design.


This website started as a fun side project and it's now a place on the internet I can finally call my own. It's built with GitHub pages, Jekyll, and [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
